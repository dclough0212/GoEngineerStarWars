# GoEngineerStarWars
A Star Wars API Coding Exercise

Setup:
  Database:  A user will need to be created on the SQL server that is a member of the sysadmin server role.  Specify this user in the connection string in the appsettings.config file 

  The database should be created automatically through EF code first.

  The main screen should look like this after the records have been pulled from the API.

  Click on the column headers to sort by column.

  Refresh From API button resets all the records from the API

  Douple clicking on a row put the row in edit mode.  Edit action button does same.

  ToDo:  1. Needs a mechanism to add/remove Films and Actors
        2. Starwars font not working on my system.
        3.  Add mech onEnter in edit mode to save record and close edit mode.  Nice to have.  Save button does same.
